CS 591 E2 Final Project: Social Network for Bets and Challenges. Team: AliasX


Our app, MoneyBall, is the new social network for bets and challenges! MoneyBall allows users to create and join groups for lighthearted wagers regarding anything at all - from sports, to traffic, to whether your friend James will puke after eating 15 hotdogs. Trash talk with your friends using our built-in chat feature, and propose wagers within your group. View live statistics for NBA games to see what you could wager on, and what the results were. Wager losers have the option to pay their friends using a payment service, or pay up by completing a challenge and uploading a recording using our YouTube API integration. 
Want to watch your best friend slap himself? Join MoneyBall today - where money isnâ€™t always the biggest prize.
Setup: Attached in the folder is the Challenge Upload Youtube APK along with the MoneyBall app, in addition a SHA-1 certificate may be needed in order for authorization to be accepted using the Youtube and Google+ API in order for you to upload challenges to Youtube. Other than that app works out of the box. When running you will be able to create & join groups, invite friends, chat, check recent NBA stats, propose bets, and begin competing with your friends on MoneyBall, the social network for bets and challenges!
